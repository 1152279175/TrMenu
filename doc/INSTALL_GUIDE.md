# TabooLib Install Guide

TrMenu uses [TabooLib](https://github.com/TabooLib) as its only dependency, which doesn't work as a plugin

For many reasons, external downloading of TabooLib automatically is not allowed on some resources platforms.
Which means you have to follow this instruction to install it properly.
